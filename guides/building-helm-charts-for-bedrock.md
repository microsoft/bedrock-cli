# Building Helm Charts for Bedrock CLI

### Prerequsities

- This guide assumes that you are familiar with understanding and creating
  [helm charts](https://helm.sh) - which are consumed by
  [fabrikate](https://github.com/microsoft/fabrikate) and `bedrock`.

- It also assumes that you have set up your `bedrock` project, and installed all
  necessary pipelines created via `bedrock project init` (the lifecycle
  pipeline), `bedrock service create` (build update hld pipeline), and
  `bedrock hld init` (manifest generation pipeline).

- A helm chart with values.yaml containing
  [mandatory values](#mandatory-helm-chart-configuration).

### Introduction

Recall the three git repositories that exist, and the pipelines that exist
between them:

![Repositories and pipelines](./images/bedrock-resource-diagram.png)

In this guide, we assume a single application repository with a single service,
a high level definition repository, and a materialized manifest repository, and
all relevant pipelines between.

When building applications that deploy with `bedrock` pipelines, it is important
to consider the structure of the helm chart that is ultimately rendered to
Kubernetes manifests, and applied to your Kubernetes cluster. For this guide,
refer to the following `bedrock.yaml` file at the root of an application source
repository, and the packaged [sample helm chart](./sample-helm-chart) that
allows `bedrock` created pipelines to operationalize building, updating, and
deploying container images to your cluster.

```yaml
rings:
  dev:
    isDefault: true
services:
  - displayName: "fabrikam"
    path: ./
    helm:
      chart:
        branch: master
        git: "https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam/frontend/_git/charts"
        path: frontend
    k8sBackend: "fabrikam-k8s-svc"
    k8sBackendPort: 80
    middlewares: []
    pathPrefix: "fabrikam-service"
    pathPrefixMajorVersion: "v1"
variableGroups:
  - fabrikam-vg
```

The above service `fabrikam` was added to `bedrock.yaml` by invoking
`bedrock service create` with the requisite parameters ie:

```sh
bedrock service create fabrikam . \
--display-name fabrikam \
--helm-config-git https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam/frontend/_git/charts \
--helm-config-path frontend \
--helm-config-branch master \
--k8s-backend fabrikam-k8s-svc \
--k8s-backend-port 80 \
--path-prefix fabrikam-service \
--path-prefix-major-version v1
```

When the above `bedrock.yaml` is committed and pushed to its git repository, the
`hld-lifecycle` pipeline (which is generated and installed by
`bedrock project init` and `bedrock project install-lifecycle-pipeline`) will
consume the `bedrock.yaml` file and produce an initial HLD (a fabrikate
consumable â€“ see
[this document](https://github.com/microsoft/fabrikate/blob/master/docs/component.md)
for more details regarding its structure) that represents the structure to be
consumed consumed by Fabrikate and rendered to Kubernetes manifests.

### Breaking down a HLD

#### Generated HLD

A HLD is generated from the `hld-lifecycle` pipeline, from any changes that are
made to `bedrock.yaml`. This HLD will be a tree structure of directories and
files, resembling the following:

![Generated HLD from lifecycle pipeline](./images/bedrock-hld-generated.png)

Note the highlighted files: the top level `common.yaml` (orange), the chart
level `component.yaml` (green), the ring level `common.yaml` (blue), and the
`ingress-route.yaml` for traefik2 (purple). The `hld-lifecycle`, after
scaffolding these files, will create a git pull request against the `master`
branch on Azure DevOps with these files added. When merged into `master`, the
`manifest-generation` [pipeline](#manifest-generation-pipeline) is kicked off.

We will explore the contents of each of these files individually, starting with
the top level `common.yaml`.

#### Top level configuration

![Configured top level common.yaml in HLD](./images/bedrock-hld-top-level-config-generated.png)

This file represents the "entry point" in configuring a running container image.
This configuration is ever changing - every new git merge to the `dev` branch of
the application source repository will trigger the `build-update-hld` pipeline
for the `fabrikam` service which will build a new container image, and tag it
with a build id tag, and set the image ID on the HLD at this `common.yaml` file.

The highlighted line in red is the tag of the container image that has been
configured for the service `fabrikam` for ring `dev`. Later (in the
`manifest-generation` pipeline), this configuration is applied onto the Helm
chart configured in `component.yaml`, discussed below.

#### Chart level configuration

![Configured chart configuration component.yaml](./images/bedrock-hld-chart-configuration-component-yaml.png)

The `hld-lifecycle` pipeline scaffolds the above component.yaml with two
subcomponents. The first subcomponent, simply called `chart` references a helm
chart and has the same configuration a user provides to
`bedrock service create`, which is written to `bedrock.yaml`. The relevant lines
from `bedrock.yaml` are below:

```yaml
helm:
  chart:
    branch: master
    git: "https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam/frontend/_git/charts"
    path: frontend
```

The above configuration presumes that you have a _seperate_ git repository that
contains a helm chart in the `frontend` path. This helm chart is further
configured by a scaffolded configuration from the `hld-lifecycle` pipeline. For
reference, a "compatible" helm chart for `bedrock` is
[provided here](./sample-helm-chart).

#### Ring level configuration

![Generated ring configuration common.yaml](./images/bedrock-hld-ring-configuration.png)

The above `common.yaml` configures the subcomponent `chart` from the
`component.yaml` above to configure a `serviceName` for the helm chart,
`fabrikam-k8s-svc-dev`. This configuration is produced from the `hld-lifecycle`
pipeline, and consumes configuration a user provides via
`bedrock service create`, which is written to `bedrock.yaml`. The relevant lines
consumed from `bedrock.yaml` are below:

```yaml
rings:
  dev:
    isDefault: true
services:
  - path: ./
    k8sBackend: 'fabrikam-k8s-svc'
    ...
```

The `serviceName` is generated from a combination of the `k8sBackend`,
`fabrikam-k8s-svc`, and the ring name, in this case `dev`.

#### Static configuration

The second subcomponent in the `component.yaml` above references a subdirectory
at the same level, named `static`. This subdirectory contains a generated
Traefik IngressRoute from the `hld-lifecycle` pipeline, which is a static
Kubernetes manifest and can be directly applied to a cluster.

![Generated Ingress Route](./images/bedrock-hld-generated-ingress-route.png)

The `hld-lifecycle` pipeline scaffolds the above
[Traefik2 IngressRoute](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/providers/kubernetes-crd/)
from configuration a user provides via `bedrock service create`, which is writen
to `bedrock.yaml`. The relevant lines consumed from `bedrock.yaml` are below:

```yaml
rings:
  dev:
    isDefault: true
services:
  - path: ./
    ...
    displayName: 'fabrikam'
    k8sBackend: 'fabrikam-k8s-svc'
    pathPrefix: 'fabrikam-service'
    pathPrefixMajorVersion: 'v1'
```

- The name of the IngressRoute, `fabrikam-dev` is generated from a combination
  of the displayName and the ring name (in this case, `dev`).

- The match rule, `PathPrefix('/v1/fabrikam-service') && Headers('Ring', 'dev')`
  is generated from a combination of the `pathPrefixMajorVersion`, the
  `pathPrefix` and the ring name (once again `dev`).

- The backing service `fabrikam-k8s-svc-dev`, (highlighted in green) is
  generated from `k8sBackend` and the ring name (`dev`).

#### Mandatory Helm Chart Configuration

Take a look at the [packaged reference helm chart](./sample-helm-chart), it
contains a `values.yaml`, which is a set of default values for helm charts:

```yaml
image:
  tag: stable
  repository: ""

serviceName: "service"
```

This set of values is the _required_ set of values for `bedrock` created
pipelines to operationalize building, updating, and deploying container images
to your cluster.

`image.tag`: This configuration is overriden by the values from the
[top-level configuration](#top-level-configuration)

`serviceName`: This configuration is overriden by the values form the
[ring-level-configuration](#ring-level-configuration) file.

`image.repository`: This configuration is a special configuration, that can
_only_ configured by a pipeline variable, `ACR_NAME`. `ACR_NAME` must be
configured to be strictly the name of the Azure Container Registry, _not_ it's
fully qualified url ie. `fabrikam` instead of `fabrikam.azurecr.io`.

### Manifest generation pipeline

The manifest generation pipeline is created by:

1. Invoking `bedrock hld init`
2. Committing and pushing the outputted artifacts
3. Installing the generated pipelines yaml file by invoking
   `bedrock hld install-manifest-pipeline` in a HLD repository.

This pipeline will be triggered off _any_ changes to the `master` branch of the
HLD repository, rendering the HLD to static Kubernetes manifests that are
consumed by a cluster.

From the `bedrock.yaml` referenced in the [introduction](#introduction), and the
[generated HLD](#generated-hld), along with the outputted configuration from the
[top-level configuration](#top-level-configuration) and the
[ring-level-configuration](#ring-level-configuration) files, a helm chart is
rendered to static Kubernetes manifests and pushed to a manifest repository.

We expect two manifests to be rendered, which are discussed below

#### Kubernetes Service

![Rendered Kubernetes Service](./images/bedrock-rendered-service.png)

This is simply a
[Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
that contains two pieces of rendered metadata, both propagated to the `Service`
from [ring level configuration](#ring-level-configuration) originally generated
from the `hld-lifecycle` pipeline. The `selector` in this `service` targets a
Kubernetes `Deployment` that maintains the same label.

##### A note on Service Types

The Kubernetes Service scaffolded by the
[provided helm chart](./sample-helm-chart) _explicitly_ does not specify a
service type. By default, Kubernetes services are created as `ClusterIP`,
meaning that the Kubernetes Service is bound to a cluster _internal_ IP address,
preventing external users from accessing the service. While a user can choose to
utilize an opposing Kubernetes Service type, `LoadBalancer` within their Helm
Charts, it is inadvisible - as this binds an _external_ and _public_ IP address
to the Kubernetes Service, allowing external users to access the Kubernetes
Service. For more information on service types, and their routing implications,
refer to the Kubernetes Documentation
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

To allow external traffic (ie ingress traffic) to be routed to Services hosted
on the cluster, `bedrock` utilizes the `traefik2` ingress controller and
associated `IngressRoute` rules to allow external traffic to be routed into your
cluster from a single endpoint. An Ingress Controller can be be configured to
handle all kinds of scenarios that you may want to handle when running services
in produciton, such as circuit breaking or traffic throttling - please refer to
the `traefik2`
[configuration introduction](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/getting-started/configuration-overview/)
for more details. Further, assuming a correctly configured helm chart with all
the [requsitite values](#mandatory-helm-chart-configuration), `bedrock` builds
and scaffolds an `IngressRoute` for a service and its associated rings
automatically. Refer to [static configuration](#static-configuration) for more
details.

#### Kubernetes Deployment

![Rendered Kubernetes Deployment](./images/bedrock-rendered-deployment.png)

This is simply a
[Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
that contains two pieces of rendered metadata, with the `name` and the label
`selector` propagated to the `Deployment` from
[ring level configuration](#ring-level-configuration), and the container image
tag propagated to the `Deployment` from the image tag set in
[top-level-configuration](#top-level-configuration).
