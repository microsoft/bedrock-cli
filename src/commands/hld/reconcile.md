## Description

The reconcile feature scaffolds a HLD with the services in the `bedrock.yaml`
file at the root level of the application repository. Recall that in a
mono-repo, `bedrock service create` will add an entry into the `bedrock.yaml`
corresponding to all tracked services. When the service has been merged into
`master` of the application repository, a pipeline (see `hld-lifecycle.yaml`,
created by `bedrock project init`) runs `bedrock hld reconcile` to add any _new_
services tracked in `bedrock.yaml` to the HLD.

As of version v0.6.0 and the addition of `bedrock ring` commands,
`bedrock hld reconcile` will add rings to the corresponding application
repository directory in the HLD repository. Additionally, as of v0.6.1, the
reconcile command will also remove rings from the corresponding application
repository directory in the HLD repository.

This command is _intended_ to be run in a pipeline (see the generated
`hld-lifecycle.yaml` created from `bedrock project init`), but can be run by the
user in a CLI for verification.

For a `bedrock.yaml` file that contained within the
`https://dev.azure.com/foo/bar/_git` repository, that has the following
structure:

```yaml
rings:
  master:
    isDefault: true
services:
  - path: ./services/fabrikam
    displayName: "fabrikam"
    k8sBackendPort: 8001
    k8sBackend: "fabrikam-k8s-svc"
    pathPrefix: "fabrikam-service"
    pathPrefixMajorVersion: "v1"
    helm:
      chart:
        branch: master
        git: "https://dev.azure.com/foo/bar/_git"
        path: stable/fabrikam-application
    middlewares:
      - ""
variableGroups:
  - fabrikam-vg
```

A HLD is produced that resembles the following:

```
├── component.yaml
└── fabrikam
    ├── access.yaml
    ├── component.yaml
    ├── config
    │   └── common.yaml
    └── fabrikam
        ├── component.yaml
        ├── config
        │   └── common.yaml
        └── master
            ├── component.yaml
            ├── config
            │   └── common.yaml
            └── static
                ├── ingress-route.yaml
                └── middlewares.yaml
```

With the `ingress-route.yaml` representing a
[Traefik2 Ingress Route](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/#kind-ingressroute)
backed by a Kubernetes Service, and the `middlewares.yaml` representing a
[Traefik2 Middleware](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/#kind-middleware)
that strips path prefixes.

For the `bedrock.yaml` shown above, the `ingress-route.yaml` produced is:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: fabrikam-master
spec:
  routes:
    - kind: Rule
      match: "PathPrefix(`/v1/fabrikam-service`) && Headers(`Ring`, `master`)"
      middlewares:
        - name: fabrikam-master
      services:
        - name: fabrikam-k8s-svc-master
          port: 8001
```

And the `middlewares.yaml` produced is:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: fabrikam-master
spec:
  stripPrefix:
    forceSlash: false
    prefixes:
      - /v1/fabrikam-service
```

Note that there exists a third generated file, `access.yaml`. For the above
`bedrock.yaml`, `access.yaml` contains a single line, which represents a
[Fabrikate access.yaml definition](https://github.com/microsoft/fabrikate/blob/master/docs/auth.md#accessyaml),
allowing Fabrikate to pull Helm Charts that are contained within the same
application repository:

```yaml
"https://dev.azure.com/foo/bar/_git": ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
```

When `fabrikate` is invoked in the HLD to Manifest pipeline, it will utilize the
`ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable injected at pipeline run-time as a
Personal Access Token to pull any referenced helm charts from the application
repository.
