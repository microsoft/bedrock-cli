- `git` - at _least_ version 2.22. Follow download instructions
  [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Follow instructions to download and install the rest of the prerequisites
[here.](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/tools/prereqs/README.md)

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with `bedrock` is to following our interactive
initialization.

```bash
bedrock init -i
```

This will guide you through the process of creating a configuration.
Alternatively if you already have a [configuration file](./guide/config-file.md)
you can run the command:

```bash
bedrock init -f bedrock-config.yaml
```
